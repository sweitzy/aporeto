### Problem2: Python/Go sample:

Implement the following as described below in either go or python:

```bash
uniquify [--help|-h]
uniquify --file=<filename> --output=<output-filename> [â€”verbose]
```

This script/program should input a file with the name provided in the args called <filename>. This input file can contain millions of **lines** with duplicates.

The script/program should output a file with name provided in the args called <output-filename> with all duplicate **lines** removed.

A line is delimited by \n or \r or both
